# Testing Localized Websites with Proxy: High Precision at Hand

Ever wondered why your website looks perfect in your country but breaks or behaves oddly elsewhere? That’s when you need a [residential proxy](https://9proxy.com/?utm_source=web20&utm_id=donne123), like I did.

## What is proxy?

If you’ve ever looked into testing websites or managing multiple accounts online, you’ve probably come across the term [proxy](https://9proxy.com/?utm_source=web20&utm_id=donne123). In simple terms, a proxy acts as a middleman between your device and the internet. Instead of connecting directly to a website, your [connection](https://9proxy.com/) first passes through a proxy server, which can mask your IP address and make it look like you're browsing from another location.

There are different types of proxies (like datacenter, residential, or mobile) but for serious tasks like localized website testing, residential proxies are often the way to go. Let me explain why.

## Benefits of residential proxy

Residential proxies are IP addresses assigned to real devices by Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Unlike datacenter proxies that are easier to detect and block, residential proxies are much more reliable and trustworthy in the eyes of websites.

Here are a few reasons why I personally prefer residential proxies:

- **Less likely to be blocked**: Since the IPs come from real users, websites are less suspicious.
- **Location-specific access**: You can choose IPs from specific cities or countries, which is perfect for geo-testing.
- **Better for automation tools**: If you're using scripts or tools to monitor or test websites, residential proxies are more stable and harder to detect.

## How can residential proxy help you test localized websites?

Let’s say you just launched an e-commerce site that caters to users in multiple regions, maybe one version for users in Germany, another for Indonesia, and another for the US. You want to see what each user sees, test the user experience, check if the correct language and currency appear, verify loading times, and make sure local promotions show up correctly.

But here’s the thing: websites often auto-detect user location based on their IP. So even if you’re based in the US, visiting your own site might only show you the US version.

This is where residential proxies save the day.

By using a residential proxy from a specific country, you can “trick” the website into thinking you’re visiting from that location. That way, you get the full experience just like a real local user would. I’ve used this technique to:

- Verify if location-specific banners or promotions display correctly
- Test translations and regional content
- Check if redirect rules work properly
- Monitor performance and loading speed from different countries

It’s honestly a game-changer if you're serious about localization.

## How to choose proxy for testing localized websites?

If you’re down with this, better choose the best. If you’re choosing one for localization testing, here are a few things to look for:

- **Real residential IPs**: Confirm that the provider offers genuine residential IPs, not just datacenter ones labeled as “residential”.
- **Location coverage**: Make sure they offer a wide range of countries, and ideally even cities, so you can test specific regions.
- **Session control**: You’ll want the option to keep a session stable for a few minutes or rotate IPs quickly if needed.
- **Speed and stability**: Slow proxies can mess with your test results, especially if you’re checking performance.

## My experience with [9Proxy](https://9proxy.com/)

After trying out a few providers, I landed on [9Proxy](https://9proxy.com/?utm_source=web20&utm_id=donne123), and it’s been solid so far. What I like is that it gives me access to a large pool of rotating residential IPs across many countries, and it’s surprisingly fast and stable.

When I’m testing localized websites for clients or even just checking how our site looks in different regions, I just pick the country I need and route my connection through 9Proxy. It’s simple to set up and works with the tools I already use.

It’s also nice that their support team actually responds quickly if I run into any issues, which did not happen much actually.

If you’re testing websites across different regions or working with geo-targeted content, definitely give residential proxies a try. And honestly, 9Proxy is worth checking out, especially their pricing.
